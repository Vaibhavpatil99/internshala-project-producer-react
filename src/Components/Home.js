                        <p>A Producer Company was introduced in India with the Companies Act, 2013. It gives persons engaged in activities related to producing (what has been grown or produced, particularly by farming) the opportunity to form a company. A producer company can be formed by 10 or more producers (persons involved in, or in activities related to, produce or growth), two or more producer institutions or a combination of 10 or more producers and producer institutions. Such a company can only have equity capital, require a minimum of five directors and an authorised capital of Rs. 5 lakh. The procedure for forming a Producer company is similar to the one for forming a private limited company.</p>

                            <h2 className='text-lg font-bold my-2'>Limited Liability</h2>
                            <p>All businesses can run the risk of not being able to repay their liabilities. It is a necessary evil. In this event, a sole proprietor (or individual producer) would be personally liable for all the debts of the business. The members of a producer company, on the other hand, have unlimited liability as the company is an entity in itself. Therefore, only the amount invested in the business would be lost; the personal property of the directors would be safe.</p>
                            <h2 className='text-lg font-bold my-2'>Economies Of Scale</h2>
                            <p>Only 15% of India's farmers own over two acres of land. The majority of farmers are, therefore, unable to safely unlock the advantages that come with economies of scale. With a producer company, multiple farmers can work as a collective and lower costs, reduce risk and even get access to better credit facilities. This enables better planning and bargaining power with buyers.</p>
                            <h2 className='text-lg font-bold my-2'>Better Management</h2>
                            <p>Rather than a single farmer managing the entire business, work within a producer company can be divided between its directors. The entity is managed by the Board of Management, which has a tenure of five years. Also, a Producer company has a separate legal existence, which means that it isn't affected by the death of any of its members.</p>
